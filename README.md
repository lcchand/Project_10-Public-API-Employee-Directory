# Project 10 - Public API Employee Directory

**Treehouse Tech Degree Project** - Use a Public API to Create a Front End for an Employee Directory

Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. They need a smart way to for employees to share contact information with each other. In this project, you’ll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. You’ll request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address. 

- Get and display 12 random users from The Random User Generator API 
  - Using photos and information that the API provides, you’ll display 12 users, along with some basic information: 
  - Image
  - First and Last Name Email
  - City 
- Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user’s row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window: 
  - Image
  - Name
  - Username
  - Email
  - Cell Number
  - Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, country and post code. 
  - Birthdate 
- Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup. 
  - Display the users in a grid or table
  - Add a hover state to the rows of the user table. 
  - Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window
